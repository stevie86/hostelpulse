# Work Packages: Consolidate Outstanding Changes

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/consolidate-outstanding-changes/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md (outstanding changes); spec.md not present
**Tests**: No testing work packages included as not explicitly requested.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package must be independently deliverable and testable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/` generated by this process. Treat this file as the high-level checklist; keep deep implementation detail inside the prompt files.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`

- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Include precise file paths or modules.

## Path Conventions

- Web app: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `prisma/`, etc.

---

## Work Package WP01: Quality Assurance (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Ensure all code passes linting, type checking, and testing before consolidation.
**Independent Test**: All linting, type checking, and tests pass without errors.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP01-quality-assurance.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [ ] T001 Run ESLint across all modified files
- [ ] T002 Fix any linting errors
- [ ] T003 Run TypeScript type checking
- [ ] T004 Resolve any type errors
- [ ] T005 Run Jest unit tests
- [ ] T006 Fix any failing tests
- [ ] T007 Run Playwright E2E tests
- [ ] T008 Validate new UI components functionality
- [ ] T009 [P] Validate README update
- [ ] T010 [P] Review AGENTS.md
- [ ] T011 [P] Check API documentation
- [ ] T012 [P] Validate business documentation

### Implementation Notes

- Run commands from project root.
- Fix issues as they arise, update code to meet standards.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Documentation validation (T009-T012) can be done in parallel.

### Dependencies

- None.

### Risks & Mitigations

- Failing tests may indicate broken functionality; ensure fixes maintain features.

## Work Package WP02: Commit Preparation (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Organize changes into logical commit groups as per implementation plan.
**Independent Test**: All changes grouped and ready for commit.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP02-commit-preparation.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [ ] T013 Prepare UI/UX enhancements commit group
- [ ] T014 Create UI/UX commit
- [ ] T015 Prepare documentation updates commit group
- [ ] T016 Create documentation commit
- [ ] T017 Prepare configuration & infrastructure commit group
- [ ] T018 Create configuration commit
- [ ] T019 Prepare database & testing commit group
- [ ] T020 Create database/testing commit

### Implementation Notes

- Group files as listed in research.md.
- Create separate commits for each group.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Preparation of different groups can be parallel if no conflicts.

### Dependencies

- Depends on WP01.

### Risks & Mitigations

- Overlapping changes; ensure groups are distinct.

---

## Work Package WP03: Git Operations (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Execute git workflow to commit, push, and create PR.
**Independent Test**: Changes committed, pushed, PR created.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP03-git-operations.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [ ] T021 Create feature branch (if not already)
- [ ] T022 Add all changes to staging
- [ ] T023 Create comprehensive commit (or separate if needed)
- [ ] T024 Push to GitHub
- [ ] T025 Create pull request
- [ ] T026 Prepare deployment (manual or automated)

### Implementation Notes

- Follow the git commands in plan.md.
- If separate commits, adjust accordingly.

### Parallel Opportunities

- None major.

### Dependencies

- Depends on WP02.

### Risks & Mitigations

- Merge conflicts; resolve carefully.

---

## Work Package WP04: Validation & Communication (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Validate deployment and communicate with stakeholders.
**Independent Test**: Production validated, stakeholders notified.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP04-validation-communication.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [ ] T027 Post-deployment validation
- [ ] T028 Stakeholder communication

### Implementation Notes

- Test in production, send updates.

### Parallel Opportunities

- None.

### Dependencies

- Depends on WP03.

### Risks & Mitigations

- Deployment issues; have rollback plan.

---

## Dependency & Execution Summary

- **Sequence**: WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP04
- **Parallelization**: Documentation validation in WP01 can be parallel.
- **MVP Scope**: All work packages required for complete consolidation.
