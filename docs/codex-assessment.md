# Codex Assessment — Hostelpulse MVP Progress

## Overall Impression
The project has made strong strides toward a usable hostel-owner MVP. Recent work tightened the bookings API with partial-update safeguards and introduced a thoughtful guest CSV dry-run flow. Documentation hygiene (AGENTS guide, sprint plans) and lint alignment demonstrate healthy engineering discipline. The repo is well structured around Next.js conventions, and you have a clear grasp on the import → manage → audit narrative that anchors the product.

## Strengths
- **API Guardrails**: Defensive checks in bookings PUT and the emerging CSV flows reduce the risk of data corruption—a must for trust.
- **Operational Transparency**: The dry-run preview and session logs surface what changed, making manual QA realistic while Jest tooling is still limited.
- **Process Awareness**: Sprint documentation, backlog triage, and branch protection all signal a mature workflow even in a solo context.

## Risks & Gaps
- **Testing Debt**: Jest installs/timeouts have delayed automated coverage. The longer this persists, the harder it will be to prove regression safety as features multiply.
- **Bookings CSV & UI Parity**: Guests import is nearly done, but bookings CSV + management UI conflict messaging remain outstanding. Without them, the MVP promise (import → manage → audit) is incomplete.
- **Stale PR Backlog**: Legacy PRs (#23, #21, #20, #19, #7, #6) still fail checks or lag behind. They risk reintroducing lint issues or conflicting with the refreshed main if left unattended.

## Recommendations
1. Land the guest CSV PR (#37) and immediately attack the bookings CSV flow on a fresh branch while the context is warm.
2. Schedule time to restore CI testing (lint/test) end-to-end; consider lightweight API smoke scripts until Jest is available.
3. Revisit or close the stale PRs after rebasing—merge only the ones that still align with MVP scope to avoid regression churn.
4. Continue expanding the regression checklist; once bookings import is ready, run full import → management → audit drills before demo.

With these items addressed, Hostelpulse should have a confident story for stakeholders and a tighter feedback loop for future iterations.
