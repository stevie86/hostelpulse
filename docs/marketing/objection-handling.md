## Objection Handling

“We already use a big PMS.”
- Keep it. Hostelpulse sits on top for daily ops. No migration, no lock‑in. Import sheets, export any time.

“It’s too expensive.”
- If we save one paid night/month, it pays for itself. Starter is €39/mo, month‑to‑month, 14‑day free pilot, no setup fee.

“Beds24 is only €15.90/mo — why pay more?”
- Beds24 is excellent for channel management. Hostelpulse complements it: we make arrivals/departures, housekeeping, and CSVs a 10‑minute task. Together you get channel sync plus a fast daily console — still far cheaper than a full PMS suite.

“Cloudbeds is expensive, but includes everything — why not pick it?”
- If you’re ready to migrate to a full suite, Cloudbeds is great. If you want value this week without a migration, keep your channel manager and add Hostelpulse. Often, Beds24 + Hostelpulse costs much less than a suite, and our “one‑night guarantee” lowers your risk.

“We’re too busy to change tools.”
- Setup is under 30 minutes. Today board, housekeeping list, and CSV are ready day one.

“Is our data safe?”
- Data hosted in the EU; export any time. You own your data.
