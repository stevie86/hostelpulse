## Objection Handling

“We already use a big PMS.”
- Keep it. Hostelpulse sits on top for daily ops. No migration, no lock‑in. Import sheets, export any time.

“It’s too expensive.”
- If we save one paid night/month, it pays for itself. Starter is €39/mo, month‑to‑month, 14‑day free pilot, no setup fee.

“We’re too busy to change tools.”
- Setup is under 30 minutes. Today board, housekeeping list, and CSV are ready day one.

“Is our data safe?”
- Data hosted in the EU; export any time. You own your data.
