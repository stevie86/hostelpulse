Subject: Save one paid night/month with a simple Owner Console

Hi {First Name},

I’m piloting a lightweight Owner Console for hostels in {city}: arrivals/departures in one place, quick guest messages, housekeeping list, and simple CSV import/export. If it doesn’t save you at least one paid night this month, we comp the fee. Can we do a 20‑minute call this week? I’ll set up a 14‑day free pilot for you.

Running a 2‑week pilot of a small Owner Console (arrivals/departures, housekeeping, quick WhatsApp/Email, city‑tax export). Import your sheet, go live same day. If it doesn’t save one night/month, we comp the fee. Message me for a 20‑minute walkthrough and a free pilot.
