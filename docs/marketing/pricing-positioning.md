## Pricing & Positioning

Positioning
- “Turn arrivals/departures into a 10‑minute task.”
- “If it saves one paid night/month, it pays for itself.”
- Coexists with your current channel manager; no migration.

Plans
- Starter €39/mo: Today board, Guests/Bookings, housekeeping list, CSV import/export, city‑tax export, door‑code emails.
- Pro €69–€79/mo: Late‑arrival alerts, payment links/receipts, multi‑property, branded emails.
- Month‑to‑month, 14‑day free pilot, no setup fee.
 - Success metric in plain terms: “≥1 night/month saved OR ≥30 minutes/day saved.” If neither is true in the first month, we comp the fee.

Competitive pricing notes (owner language)
- Beds24: “from €15.90/month, no contract” — great for channel management. Keep Beds24 for channels; add Hostelpulse to make the day take 10 minutes. Combined cost is still far below full PMS suites.
- Cloudbeds: priced as a full suite (PMS + channels + payments). If you don’t want a migration, Beds24 + Hostelpulse gives you channel sync plus a fast daily console at a fraction of suite pricing.

Guarantee
- “If we don’t save you at least one paid night in 30 days, we comp your fee.”
