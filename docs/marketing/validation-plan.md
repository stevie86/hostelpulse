## 7‑Day Validation Plan

Objective: Move from one owner to 5–8 owner conversations and 1–2 paid pilots with a clear “one more night/month” value story.

Day 1–2 — Outreach (+bookings)
- DM/email 20–30 prospects: local hostel association, FB/WhatsApp groups, Hostelworld forums, Airbnb hosts, LinkedIn.
- Offer: 20‑minute chat + 1‑month free pilot. Goal: book 6–8 calls.

Day 3–4 — Interviews (10 questions)
- Run calls using interview-guide.md. Capture current tools, time spent per task, last mistake that cost a night, and price tolerance.
- Outcome: clearly ranked pains; baseline minutes/day and paid‑night value per hostel.

Day 4–5 — Pilots (2 weeks)
- Convert 1–2 owners into pilots. Success metric: ≥1 night recovered or ≥30 minutes/day saved.
- Setup: import spreadsheet (CSV), enable Today quick actions, housekeeping list, door‑code email.

Day 6–7 — Synthesis & close
- Summarize quantified value (minutes → nights → €) per pilot.
- Ask for testimonial if metric met (“Saved me 2 nights this month”). Convert to Starter plan.

Artifacts to collect
- Minutes saved/day, conflicts prevented, late arrivals salvaged.
- City‑tax report/export usage counts.
- 1–2 quotes with concrete outcomes.
