## Metrics & Instrumentation

Dashboard counters (visible to owner)
- Conflicts prevented (bookings that would have overlapped)
- Late arrivals salvaged (messaged and checked in after reminder)
- Rooms turned on time (departed→cleaned before arrival)
- Minutes saved today (self‑input or simple heuristic)

Backend events (for us)
- Booking conflict check triggered → blocked
- Reminder sent → check‑in within X hours
- Housekeeping list generated → tasks completed
- CSV import/export counts

Reporting
- Monthly summary: “Estimated nights saved” and “minutes saved/day” → convert to € using owner’s own price inputs.
