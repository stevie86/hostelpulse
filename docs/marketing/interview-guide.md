## Interview Guide (20 minutes)

Goal: Understand today’s workflow in minutes and nights, not software terms.

1) Walk me through today’s arrivals and departures. What took the longest?
2) How do you check guests in/out? Who does it? On phone or desktop?
3) When did a mistake last cost you a paid night? What happened?
4) How do you prevent double‑bookings today?
5) How do you handle late arrivals (after 20:00)? What do you message them?
6) How do you keep a housekeeping list? Who sees it? Can they print it?
7) City/tourist tax: how do you prepare monthly totals?
8) If this saved you 30–60 minutes per day, what would you do with that time?
9) Price tolerance: would saving one paid night/month justify €39–€69?
10) Pilot: would you try a 14‑day free pilot if setup is under 30 minutes?

Capture
- Minutes per task: arrivals/departures, comms, housekeeping, city‑tax.
- Errors: conflicts, no‑shows, late check‑in friction.
- Tools: spreadsheets, WhatsApp/email, PMS/channel manager.
