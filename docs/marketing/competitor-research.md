# Competitor Research (Owner‑First)

Purpose: Help us win owner conversations by focusing on minutes saved, nights protected, and zero‑migration adoption — not feature bloat.

Scope covered here: Cloudbeds, Beds24, Sirvoy Pro, FrontDesk Master — and how Hostelpulse stacks up.

## Executive Summary

- Giants sell full “PMS + Channel Manager + Booking Engine + Payments” suites. Powerful, but costly and time‑consuming for 20–60‑bed hostels.
- Hostelpulse wins when the owner wants value today: a 10‑minute day for arrivals/departures, quick guest comms, printable housekeeping, CSV import/export, and simple exports (city/tourist tax) — with no migration.
- Pricing story that resonates: “If we save one paid night a month, we pay for ourselves.” Month‑to‑month, EU‑hosted, export anytime, owner language (not PMS jargon).

## At‑a‑Glance (Owner Lens)

- Adoption speed: Hostelpulse (same‑day) < Sirvoy (days) < FrontDesk Master (days) < Beds24 (days/weeks, DIY) < Cloudbeds (weeks, onboarding)
- Total cost (software + time): Hostelpulse lowest for daily ops; Cloudbeds highest but most comprehensive.
- Best for 20–60 beds with spreadsheets/WhatsApp: Hostelpulse
- Best for full replacement and multi‑property: Cloudbeds; FrontDesk Master (hostel‑centric)
- Best for highly configurable low‑cost stack, tech‑savvy: Beds24
- Best for simpler PMS replacement with booking engine: Sirvoy Pro

## Competitor Profiles

### Cloudbeds
- Strengths
  - Full suite: PMS, channel manager, booking engine, payments, automations, marketplace integrations.
  - Deep reporting, multi‑property support, strong ecosystem.
- Trade‑offs
  - Higher monthly cost and onboarding investment; requires process change/training.
  - Heavy for owners who just need today’s work to be faster.
  - Pricing note: Cloudbeds is a full suite (PMS + channels + payments). If you’re not ready for a migration, the combined cost of Beds24 (~€15.90) + Hostelpulse (€39) remains well below a suite while delivering channel sync plus a fast daily console. Month‑to‑month and our “one‑night guarantee” reduce risk.
- Best fit
  - Medium/large properties, multi‑property operators ready to standardize everything.
- Risks for small hostels
  - “We’ll do it later” syndrome (defer purchase), or churn due to complexity.

### Beds24
- Strengths
  - Very configurable, strong channel management, flexible automation; competitive pricing.
  - Favored by tech‑comfortable owners who like to build their own stack.
- Trade‑offs
  - DIY setup can be time‑consuming; interface is dense, learning curve is real.
  - Owner language is secondary to configuration; staff‑friendliness varies.
- Best fit
  - Tech‑savvy, budget‑sensitive owners willing to invest time in configuration.
 - Pricing note
   - “From €15.90/month, no contract.” That’s excellent for channel management. Hostelpulse complements Beds24: keep your channel sync, add a 10‑minute daily console — often still cheaper than a full PMS suite.

### Sirvoy Pro
- Strengths
  - Clean PMS basics, booking engine, channel connections; simpler than many suites.
  - Lower onboarding friction than top‑end suites.
- Trade‑offs
  - Still a PMS switch; less hostel‑specific (dorm/bed nuance) and fewer “today” shortcuts.
- Best fit
  - Small hotels/BNBs, hostels that want a contained PMS without extreme complexity.

### FrontDesk Master
- Strengths
  - Hostel‑oriented PMS (beds/dorms), housekeeping, channel management; proven in hostel segment.
  - More hostel‑specific workflows than generic PMSs.
- Trade‑offs
  - A full system switch; cost + training + process migration.
  - Daily ops still sit inside a large PMS, more clicks/fields than a focused console.
- Best fit
  - Hostels committed to a full PMS replacement in the near term.

## Hostelpulse Positioning

- Wedge: “10‑minute day” — arrivals/departures, quick check‑in/out, guest comms (WhatsApp/Email), housekeeping list, and CSV import/export.
- Coexistence: Works on top of the current setup (spreadsheets or an existing channel manager). No migration; export anytime. EU‑hosted.
- Value metric: “Nights saved” — conflicts prevented, late arrivals salvaged, rooms turned on time; simple city‑tax export. If we save one night, we pay for ourselves.
- Pricing story: Starter €39/mo (month‑to‑month, 14‑day pilot, no setup). Pro adds alerts, payment links, multi‑property.

## Workflow Comparison (Owner Tasks)

- Today (arrivals/departures)
  - Hostelpulse: clear, one‑tap updates (in scope); built around “what’s next?”
  - Suites: exist, but nested in heavier PMS flows.
- Prevent double‑bookings
  - Hostelpulse: conflict checks for rooms/beds.
  - Suites: yes; typically tied to channel sync setup.
- Guest communications
  - Hostelpulse: quick WhatsApp/Email; “send door code” email (simple template).
  - Suites: templates/sequences within automation modules.
- Housekeeping
  - Hostelpulse: printable list; CSV for staff.
  - Suites: full modules with more steps; powerful but heavier.
- CSV import/export
  - Hostelpulse: plain‑language import (dedupe/preview on roadmap), round‑trip safe export/import.
  - Suites: often available, but more technical.
- City/tourist tax export
  - Hostelpulse: simple date‑range CSV (in scope/ready).
  - Suites: full reporting suites; flexible but complex.
- Channel manager / booking engine
  - Hostelpulse: not replacing this today; coexist.
  - Suites: core strength (Cloudbeds strongest, then Beds24/FrontDesk Master/Sirvoy).
- Payments
  - Hostelpulse: payment links + receipt (near‑term add).
  - Suites: integrated payment/folio handling.

## Battlecards (Owner‑Friendly)

- Against Cloudbeds
  - “If you’re replacing everything, Cloudbeds is great. If you want value this week without a migration, Hostelpulse fits on top — import your sheet, go live today. Beds24 + Hostelpulse is often far less than a suite, and if we don’t save one paid night this month, we comp the fee.”
- Against Beds24
  - “Beds24 is powerful if you love configuration and need channels. Keep Beds24 — add Hostelpulse to make the day take 10 minutes. Together you get channel sync plus a simple daily console.”
- Against Sirvoy Pro
  - “Sirvoy is a nice PMS. Hostelpulse is simpler: the Today board, housekeeping list, and quick message buttons your team can use right now.”
- Against FrontDesk Master
  - “It’s a solid hostel PMS. If you aren’t ready to migrate, Hostelpulse gives you the daily wins (10 minutes/day) today; you can still export anytime.”

## SWOT — Hostelpulse (Today)

- Strengths
  - Same‑day adoption; owner language; EU‑hosted; export anytime; price anchored to one night/month; daily ops focus.
- Weaknesses
  - No built‑in channel manager or booking engine (by design); fewer deep automations than suites.
- Opportunities
  - Add quick actions, housekeeping, city‑tax export, payment links, late‑arrival alerts; “nights saved” counter; case studies in {city}.
- Threats
  - Suites could simplify their “daily” views; DIY stacks (Beds24) for tech‑savvy owners.

## Roadmap Tie‑In (to beat objections)

- Week 1: Today quick actions (check‑in/out, WhatsApp/Email), housekeeping list, CSV import wizard (dedupe/preview), door‑code email.
- Week 2: City/tourist tax export by date; payment links + receipts; late‑arrival alerts.
- Dashboard counter: “Nights saved” (conflicts prevented, late arrivals salvaged, rooms turned on time) with monthly summary → € value.

## Talk Track (Owner)

- “You don’t need to switch systems. Import your sheet, and by tonight your arrivals/departures are one tap away. If we don’t save you one paid night this month, we’ll comp the fee.”
- “We’re here for the 10‑minute day — housekeeping, quick guest messages, simple exports. Keep your channel manager; we fit on top.”
