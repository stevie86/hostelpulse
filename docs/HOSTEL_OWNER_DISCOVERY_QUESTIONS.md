# Hostel Owner Discovery Questions

Use these 5 strategic questions during initial outreach calls or demos to uncover pain points and qualify prospects for HostelPulse.

## Discovery Framework

**Goal**: Understand the owner's biggest operational challenges and quantify the financial impact of current pain points.

**Approach**: Ask questions in order, follow up on interesting responses, and tie back to HostelPulse solutions.

## The 5 Key Questions

### 1. Double Booking Impact & Past Metrics

**Question**: "Can you share some metrics from the past 12 months - how many double bookings have you experienced, what was the average revenue loss per incident, and do you track these occurrences systematically?"

**Why this question:**

- Quantifies the most immediate revenue threat with specific historical data
- Reveals whether they track operational metrics (indicates sophistication level)
- Establishes credibility through concrete numbers and ROI potential
- Shows the tangible value HostelPulse can provide

**Follow-up probes:**

- "Do you have a system for tracking double bookings, or do you only notice them when they occur?"
- "What's your process for handling overbookings when they happen?"
- "How do you currently prevent conflicts across different booking channels?"
- "What's the most expensive double booking incident you've dealt with?"
- "How much time does resolving a double booking typically take?"

**HostelPulse tie-in:**

- **Immediate ROI**: "Based on your X incidents at €Y loss each, HostelPulse would save you €Z annually"
- **Time Savings**: "Plus eliminating the W hours spent resolving each incident"
- **Prevention Value**: "Our AI system prevents conflicts before they cost you money"
- **Tracking Benefits**: "HostelPulse provides automatic reporting so you'll never miss these metrics again"

**Advanced Version (for technical prospects):**
"Can you share your overbooking incident data from the past year? We're seeing patterns where automated conflict detection reduces incidents by 95% and saves €500+ per prevented overbooking."

### 2. Administrative Time Sink

**Question**: "How many hours per week do you or your staff spend on manual administrative tasks like checking guests in/out, updating spreadsheets, or managing bookings?"

**Why this question:**

- Measures operational inefficiency
- Identifies labor costs being wasted
- Shows scalability challenges

**Follow-up probes:**

- "What's the most time-consuming part of your day?"
- "How many staff members handle guest services?"
- "What tools do you currently use for these tasks?"

**HostelPulse tie-in:** "Our touch-screen POS interface reduces check-in time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, freeing up 15+ hours weekly."

### 3. Compliance Burden

**Question**: "How do you currently handle SEF reporting and tourist tax calculations for your international guests?"

**Why this question:**

- Lisbon-specific pain point (SEF = immigration authority)
- Regulatory complexity unique to tourism businesses
- High-risk area (fines up to €1000+)

**Follow-up probes:**

- "Have you ever received fines for compliance issues?"
- "How much time does compliance reporting take monthly?"
- "Do you have dedicated staff for paperwork?"

**HostelPulse tie-in:** "Automated SEF reporting and tourist tax calculations eliminate compliance errors and save 4-6 hours monthly."

### 4. Revenue Optimization

**Question**: "How do you currently set room rates and manage pricing across different booking channels?"

**Why this question:**

- Reveals pricing inefficiencies
- Shows revenue leakage opportunities
- Indicates technology maturity level

**Follow-up probes:**

- "Do you adjust prices based on demand?"
- "How many booking channels do you manage?"
- "What's your biggest pricing challenge?"

**HostelPulse tie-in:** "Smart pricing recommendations and automated availability syncing can increase occupancy by 15-25%."

### 5. Growth Aspirations

**Question**: "What's your biggest operational challenge as you plan to grow your hostel business?"

**Why this question:**
