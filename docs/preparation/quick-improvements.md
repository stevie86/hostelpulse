# Quick Improvements Summary

Snapshot of fixes and polish applied to get the MVP ready for Preview/Prod, plus targeted follow‑ups.

## Overview
- Unblocked push by purging `.kilocode` from history and adding it to `.gitignore`.
- Updated Husky pre‑push to remove deprecated shim.
- Fixed lint/build errors, improved mobile typography/UX, added consistent logout and owner navigation.

## Mobile Typography & Layout
- Global readability:
  - Wrapped app content in a `div.antialiased.text-gray-900` (in `pages/_app.tsx`) for sharper, darker text on mobile.
- Landing page (`pages/index.tsx`):
  - Hero title uses tighter leading and heavier weight; body copy uses `leading-relaxed` and responsive sizes.
  - Feature cards now use responsive headings (`text-lg sm:text-xl`) and improved paragraph contrast (`text-gray-700`).
  - “Built for Lisbon” section uses `sm:text-2xl` heading and relaxed body copy; chip row scales slightly on small screens.
- Owner tables (`pages/owner/bookings.tsx`, `pages/owner/guests.tsx`):
  - Added `overflow-x-auto` around tables so they scroll gracefully on narrow screens.
  - Table text scales (`text-xs sm:text-sm`); IDs are `whitespace-nowrap`.

## Navigation & Logout
- Added `components/OwnerNav.tsx` (Dashboard | Bookings | Guests) and inserted at the top of all owner pages.
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` now targets owner routes and includes a persistent “Sign out” button.
- `components/Header.tsx` and `pages/account.tsx` wire “Sign out” to `logout()` and navigate to `/auth/login`.

## Lint/Build Fixes (Next 12 compatibility)
- Next Link: replaced `className` on `<Link>` with anchor children where needed (Next 12 requires `<Link><a/></Link>`):
  - `components/PageNav.tsx`, `pages/owner/dashboard.tsx`, `pages/owner/bookings.tsx`, `pages/owner/guests.tsx`.
- Redoc page (`pages/api-docs.tsx`):
  - Removed raw `<script>`; use `next/script` and `Redoc.init('/docs/openapi.json', ...)` targeting `#redoc-container`.
- Import ordering and minor linting fixes (alphabetization and internal links).
- Auth context stubs to satisfy type usage:
  - Added `signUp(email, password)` and `resetPassword(email)` mock implementations.

## Security & CI Hygiene
- Purged `.kilocode/` from the `supabase` branch history and added to `.gitignore`.
- Action item: rotate the exposed Linear API key (revoke and create new).
- Verified pre‑push hook only runs `test:ci` (harmless for now).

## Vercel Environment
Set these in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (Preview, Production)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Preview, Production)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server‑only; Preview, Production)
Optional: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and Tina CMS vars if used.

CLI alternative (apply to all Preview branches by pressing Enter at branch prompt):
- `npx vercel@latest env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL preview`
- `npx vercel@latest env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY preview`
- `npx vercel@latest env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY preview`
- Repeat for `production`.

## Readiness Checks (Git)
- Divergence: `git rev-list --left-right --count supabase...main` → expect `AHEAD	0`.
- Common base: `git merge-base supabase main` prints a SHA.
- Diff and summary:
  - `git log --oneline main..supabase | head -n 20`
  - `git diff --name-status main..supabase`

## Follow‑ups (Fast Wins)
- A11y: convert remaining placeholder anchors without `href` to buttons or valid links (Footer, Navbar, Sidebar).
- Import order: optionally standardize across pages to silence remaining warnings.
- Typography plugin (optional): add Tailwind Typography and wrap long‑form content with `prose` for docs/blog.
- Owner shell (optional): create an Owner layout wrapping Header/Sidebar for all `/owner/*` routes.
- CI tightening: fail on lint errors only (keep warnings non‑blocking), add basic smoke tests.

## Commands Recap
- Lint/build locally:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - `npm run build`
- PR checks summary with links:
  - `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json statusCheckRollup -q '.statusCheckRollup[] | [.name, .conclusion, .detailsUrl] | @tsv'`
- Trigger Vercel redeploy:
  - `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(ci): trigger Vercel preview" && git push`
