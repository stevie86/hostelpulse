# Enhancement Roadmap (Post-MVP)

MVP focuses on import → manage → audit. Items below are deferred until after launch.

## CSV & Data
- Rich import wizard polish (animated progress, contextual help).
- OTAs/channel manager integrations (Beds24, Cloudbeds, Sirvoy) per `docs/roadmap-considerations.md`.
- Advanced dedupe (fuzzy name/email matching, preview diff highlighting).

## Reporting & Insights
- Booking/occupancy dashboards with charts (see previous sprint plan sections 2.1–2.4).
- Export to PDF, automated daily email summaries.

## Calendar & Scheduling
- Drag-and-drop room/bed calendar, multi-property switching.
- Late arrival alerts, check-in reminders.

## Mobile & UX Polish
- Fluid typography, responsive nav polish (see docs/mobile-first-development.md).
- In-app tips, empty-state walkthroughs.

## Security & Ops
- Full lint coverage in CI, import-order enforcement.
- Rate limiting & abuse monitoring for CSV endpoints.
- Audit log dashboards and retention automation.

Revisit after MVP demo and customer feedback; prioritize based on owner pain.
