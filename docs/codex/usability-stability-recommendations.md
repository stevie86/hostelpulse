# Usability and Stability Recommendations

This document proposes targeted improvements to enhance the app’s user experience and operational resilience. Items are grouped so they can be implemented incrementally.

## Usability
- Navigation clarity
  - Add active state and aria-current to nav links; ensure consistent placement of primary actions.
  - Provide a global search/command palette (e.g., cmd+k) for quick access to pages and actions.
- First‑time user onboarding
  - Add a dismissible, role-based checklist (empty states + quick-start tasks) on first login.
  - Inline “Learn more” links to docs for concepts like taxes, invoices, and sync.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Ensure color contrast ≥ 4.5:1; audit Tailwind tokens.
  - Keyboard focus outlines visible and not suppressed; skip-to-content link.
  - Add semantic headings and landmark roles; label inputs and interactive icons.
- Forms and feedback
  - Inline field validation with clear error messages; prevent destructive actions without confirmation.
  - Use optimistic UI for non-critical actions with server reconciliation and toast feedback.
- Internationalization and locale
  - Standardize via next-intl; ensure date/number formatting; prepare for Portuguese + EN.
  - Centralize copy strings; add translation keys for all user-visible text.
- Performance & perceived speed
  - Incremental/streaming rendering for expensive views; prefetch critical routes on hover.
  - Use React Query staleTime for read-mostly data; background refetch on focus.
- Mobile responsiveness
  - Add touch targets ≥ 44px; test breakpoints for key flows (auth, dashboard, invoices).
  - Implement adaptive tables (column priority, overflow patterns) and sticky headers.
- Theming & readability
  - Ship dark mode with system default; provide a font scale control (AA/AAA presets).

## Stability & Reliability
- Error handling and observability
  - Global Next.js error boundary for client; API route error middleware returning normalized error shapes.
  - Structured logging (JSON) on server; correlate request IDs across layers.
  - Add tracing/metrics (OpenTelemetry) for key flows; alert on error rate and latency spikes.
- Network resilience
  - Standardize timeouts, retries with jitter, and cancellation in fetch utilities.
  - Debounce/throttle high-frequency UI events; handle offline state with queued mutations where safe.
- Data validation and security
  - Zod schemas at API boundaries; validate both request and response.
  - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, frame-ancestors), CSRF on mutations, and input sanitization.
- Background work
  - Queue long-running tasks (email, syncs) behind idempotent API endpoints; add dead-letter handling.
- Database and migrations
  - Enforce Prisma migrations in CI; add seed scripts for stable test data.
  - Apply connection limits per environment; enable query timeouts.
- Configuration & secrets
  - Align env var names across app/CI/Vercel; validate required vars at boot with helpful errors.
  - Separate Preview vs Production variables in Vercel; prevent secret drift.
- Testing strategy
  - Unit tests: hooks/utils; Component tests with Testing Library.
  - Integration tests: API routes with an isolated DB or test containers.
  - E2E happy-path smoke on PR using Playwright; run nightly for extended coverage.
- CI/CD safeguards
  - Required checks on main (tests, lint, typecheck, preview deploy).
  - Canary deploys for risky features using feature flags and gradual rollout.
- Dependency & supply chain
  - Weekly dependency updates with Renovate; lockfile maintenance and vulnerability scanning.
  - Pin critical transitive versions where stability is required.

## Implementation Order (Suggested)
1) Observability & error middleware (logs, error shapes, request IDs)
2) Form validation + accessibility passes on auth and invoicing
3) API boundary validation (Zod) and unified fetch timeouts/retries
4) Testing baseline (unit + a few API integration + E2E smoke)
5) Performance tuning (query caching, route prefetch, table virtualization if needed)
6) Background processing for email/sync; alerts for failures
7) CSP and enhanced security headers; dark mode + readability polish

## Notes on Tooling
- Keep Bun locally but use a consistent runner in CI (npm or Bun end-to-end) for reproducibility.
- Use feature flags (simple env or a lightweight service) to ship risky changes safely.
