## Overview
Implements the complete P0 MVP as defined in the Definition of Done, including full rooms & beds support from the sprint documentation.

## Features Implemented

### Core API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/guests` - GET, POST, PUT with owner isolation
- ✅ `/api/bookings` - GET, POST, PUT with booking overlap detection (409 conflicts)
- ✅ `/api/rooms` - GET, POST with beds creation for dorms
- ✅ Booking conflict detection returns 409 for overlapping reservations

### Database Schema
- ✅ Complete schema: guests, rooms, beds, bookings
- ✅ RLS policies enabled for owner-only access
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with cascade deletes

### Dashboard UI
- ✅ Today's Arrivals/Departures cards with real data
- ✅ Recent guests overview
- ✅ Quick action buttons
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Empty states with helpful messaging

### Authentication
- ✅ Login/register pages connected to Supabase Auth
- ✅ Auto-redirect to dashboard on successful auth
- ✅ Navigation updated with dashboard link

### Rooms & Beds Support (Sprint Feature)
- ✅ Room types: private and dorm
- ✅ Beds linked to dorm rooms
- ✅ Booking system supports both room-level and bed-level reservations
- ✅ Conflict detection works for both scenarios
- ✅ API supports creating dorms with multiple beds in single request

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Supabase integration with full TypeScript definitions
- ✅ API auth middleware with JWT + admin token support
- ✅ Type safety across all components and API calls
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design

## Files Changed
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client and type definitions

- `pages/api/guests.ts` - Guest management API
- `pages/api/bookings.ts` - Booking management with conflict detection
- `pages/api/rooms.ts` - Room and bed management API
- `pages/dashboard.tsx` - Owner dashboard with Today's cards
- `pages/auth/login.tsx` - Connected to Supabase Auth

## Testing
All MVP requirements from Definition of Done are met:
- ✅ Guests: list + create/update via `/api/guests` (200 on GET, 201 on POST)
- ✅ Bookings: list + create/update via `/api/bookings`; overlap conflicts return 409
- ✅ Dashboard shows Today's Arrivals/Departures cards; empty states are clear
- ✅ Auth pages present and connected to Supabase
- ✅ Mobile-first layouts with proper tap targets

## Next Steps (P1)
- Enable `REQUIRE_API_AUTH=1` in production
- Set up Vercel environment variables
- Test RLS policies in production

## Dependencies
