# 🚀 HostelPulse MVP Roadmap - The "Lisbon Pilot" Path

_Focus: Lean, Efficient, Guest-Centric for Lisbon Hostels_

## Current Status: Building the "Heavy Lifters"
**Goal:** Deliver a system that manages the boring stuff (admin) so staff can manage the fun stuff (guests).

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (The "Comfort" Features)**

### Step 1: The "No-Stress" Check-In/Out (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Make the reception desk flow fast and error-free.
*   [ ] **Fast Check-in UI:** Search guest -> Assign Bed -> Mark "Checked In" -> Done.
*   [ ] **City Tax Calc:** Simple toggle/calculator for Lisbon City Tax (2€/night/person).
*   [ ] **Dashboard Widget:** "Arriving Today" / "Departing Today" lists (Actionable).

### Step 2: The "Bulletproof" Booking Engine (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Zero double bookings. Simple manual entry.
*   [ ] **Visual Calendar:** A simple "Bed View" to drag-and-drop or click-to-book.
*   [ ] **Conflict Guard:** Backend logic that strictly prevents overlapping bookings for the same bed.
*   [ ] **Room Moves:** Easy flow to move a guest from Bed A to Bed B.

### Step 3: Guest Communication (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Proactive hospitality.
*   [ ] **Email Triggers:** "Booking Confirmed" & "Welcome to Lisbon" (Pre-arrival).
