# Session Log â€” 2025-09-21

## Completed
- Added `AGENTS.md` to `.gitignore` and refreshed the contributor guide, committing as `docs: refresh contributor guide`.
- Archived divergent work by branching each commit (e.g., `docs/contributor-guide-refresh`, `feat/api-crud`, `ci/npm-pipeline-guard`) and pushing them to GitHub.
- Reset `main` to match `origin/main`, restoring a clean MVP baseline.
- Retrieved Vercel deployment history and current PR list to assess project status.
- Catalogued stashes (`stash@{0..2}`) and documented their contents for future recovery.
- Removed stray `bun.lock`; npm `package-lock.json` remains the dependency source of truth.
- Branched `feat/booking-partial-update` from clean `main`, applied booking PUT partial-update safeguards, pushed the branch, and opened PR #36.
- Drafted `docs/sprint-recovery-2025-09.md` to focus effort on MVP stabilization.
- Reordered imports across auth API/pages, dashboard, guests, housekeeping, and shared components to satisfy lint rules.
- Replaced plain `<a>` navigation with Next `Link` or accessible anchors in dashboard, footer, and navbar.
- Removed unused imports/variables and deprecated CSS link injection in the blog page.
- Confirmed `npm run lint` completes with zero warnings or errors.

## Notes
- Npm install for Jest tooling timed out in sandbox; revisit when network allowances improve.
- `npm run lint` exceeded sandbox timeout earlier but now completes cleanly after import fixes.
- Next focus: craft coverage (manual or Jest-based) for booking partial updates once tooling is available.
- Prism theme lazy-loading was removed from `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`; restore with a compliant approach if syntax highlighting is required later.
- Social media links in `components/Footer.tsx` now open in a new tab with proper rel attributes.
