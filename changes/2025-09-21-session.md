# Session Log â€” 2025-09-21

## Completed
- Reordered imports across auth API/pages, dashboard, guests, housekeeping, and shared components to satisfy lint rules.
- Replaced plain `<a>` navigation with Next `Link` or accessible anchors in dashboard, footer, and navbar.
- Removed unused imports/variables and deprecated CSS link injection in the blog page.
- Confirmed `npm run lint` completes with zero warnings or errors.

## Notes
- Prism theme lazy-loading was removed from `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`; restore with a compliant approach if syntax highlighting is required later.
- Social media links in `components/Footer.tsx` now open in a new tab with proper rel attributes.
