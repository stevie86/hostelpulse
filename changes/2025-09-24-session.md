# Session Log â€” 2025-09-24

## Completed
- Archived previous sprint doc (`docs/archive/sprint-recovery-2025-09.md`).
- Drafted new sprint plan `docs/sprint-mvp-finalization-2025-09.md` with current status, workstreams, and timeline toward MVP.
- Merged guest CSV dry-run flow (#37) and synced `main`.
- Implemented bookings CSV dry-run/commit API (`pages/api/csv/bookings.ts`) with overlap detection and validation.
- Extended `components/CSVImportExport` to support bookings preview, confirmation, and summary messaging.

## Notes
- Branch protection left relaxed (0 required reviews) per solo workflow preference.
- Bookings import now requires guests/rooms/beds to exist; overlapping or incomplete rows are reported in issues list.
- Next focus: wire management UI updates (conflict banners, quick actions refresh) and expand regression checklist per sprint plan.
