# Session Log — 2025-09-25

## Summary
- Guest CSV dry-run PR (#37) and bookings CSV dry-run PR (#40) merged; `main` now supports preview + confirm for both entities with conflict checks.
- Management pages (bookings/guests/rooms) updated with live stats, refresh buttons, and pending booking alerts (see PR #41).
- Branch protection review requirement remains disabled to support solo workflow.

## Next Focus
1. Merge PR #41 once satisfied, then draft a regression checklist covering import → management → audit.
2. Update README/AGENTS with finalized CSV flows and manual QA steps.
3. Revisit backlog PRs (#23, #21, #20, #19, #7, #6) to rebase or close so they don’t drift from the linted main.
4. Prepare QA notes and demo script per sprint plan for stakeholder walkthrough.
