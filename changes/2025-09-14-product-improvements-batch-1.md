## Summary — Product Improvements (Batch 1)

Date: 2025-09-14

## What was requested
Continue improving the product based on the queued next items and tighten UX around bookings and CSV import.

## Changes shipped

- Bookings — inline edit
  - Added inline edit controls per booking to update dates, status, and notes.
  - Path: `pages/bookings.tsx` (state: `editingId`, `editForm`; action: `saveEdit`).
- Bookings — creation form polish and bug fix
  - Resolved duplicate styled-component identifiers causing build issues (`Row`/`Label` collision) by introducing `FieldRow`/`FieldLabel`.
  - Path: `pages/bookings.tsx`.
- CSV Import — preview + dedupe
  - On file select, parses CSV client-side and shows a 10-row preview, total rows, and duplicates removed within the uploaded file.
  - Dedupe rules: guests by `email`; bookings by `guest_email + room_name + bed_name + check_in + check_out + status`.
  - Users confirm before import; import uses the deduped CSV.
  - Paths: `components/CSVImportExport.tsx`, `utils/csv.ts` (added `stringifyCSV`).
- Nights Saved counter
  - Local metric that increments on quick check-in/out (dashboard) and by number of nights for each new booking.
  - Displayed on Dashboard as a simple counter; updates live via a custom event.
  - Paths: `utils/metrics.ts`, `pages/dashboard.tsx`, `pages/bookings.tsx`.

## Notes / rationale

- Kept middleware out of scope; all changes stay within Pages Router and API routes.
- CSV dedupe is conservative (exact duplicates within the uploaded file). Server-side conflict/overlap checks remain authoritative.
- Nights Saved is local-first to avoid backend changes; can be replaced with a real analytics event stream later.

## Next suggestions

- CSV wizard enhancements: inline validation messages per row; optional dry-run mode via API for server-side validation before commit.
- Booking UX: add guest typeahead and unit availability hints on date change.
- Metrics: persist Nights Saved in user profile when auth is ready to avoid device-only state.
