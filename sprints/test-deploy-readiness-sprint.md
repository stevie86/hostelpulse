# Test & Deploy Readiness Sprint

## Sprint Information
- **Sprint Name**: Test & Deploy Readiness
- **Date**: September 11th - 13th, 2025 (3 days)
- **Duration**: 3 working days
- **Sprint Goal**: Achieve 100% test suite success, configure production environment, and establish deployment pipeline to Linear via MCP. Sprint completion requires green `bun run test` and successful MCP deployment.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ✅ All 66 tests passing (13 test suites)
  - ✅ Production environment fully configured
  - ✅ MCP deployment to Linear working
  - ✅ Documented deployment runbook
  - ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Current State Assessment
- **Tests**: 66 tests passing across 13 suites ✅
- **Build**: Successful production build ✅
- **Environment**: Missing production configuration
- **Deployment**: MCP configured but not tested
- **Security**: Needs audit and hardening

## Sprint Backlog

### Day 1: Test Suite Optimization & Environment Setup

#### 1. Test Suite Enhancement (Priority: High, Estimate: 2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Fix SendGrid test console error**: The sendEmail test logs SendGrid error but doesn't fail - investigate and mock properly
- [ ] **Add integration tests**: Create tests for blog MDX processing and authentication flows
- [ ] **Add component integration tests**: Test blog components with MDX rendering
- [ ] **Performance test baseline**: Establish performance benchmarks for key operations
- [ ] **Test coverage analysis**: Ensure minimum 80% coverage across critical paths

#### 2. Environment Configuration (Priority: High, Estimate: 3-4 hours)
- [ ] **Production .env setup**: Configure all required environment variables for production
- [ ] **Supabase production setup**: Configure database connections and RLS policies
- [ ] **SendGrid production configuration**: Set up email service for production
- [ ] **Vercel deployment configuration**: Configure build settings and environment variables
- [ ] **Database migration scripts**: Create production database setup scripts

### Day 2: Security & Production Readiness

#### 3. Security Audit & Hardening (Priority: High, Estimate: 4-5 hours)
- [ ] **Dependency vulnerability scan**: Run security audit on all dependencies
- [ ] **Environment variable validation**: Ensure no secrets are exposed in client-side code
- [ ] **API security review**: Audit authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] **CORS configuration**: Set up proper CORS policies for production
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Implement API rate limiting for production
- [ ] **Input validation**: Strengthen input sanitization across all forms

#### 4. Production Optimization (Priority: Medium, Estimate: 3-4 hours)
- [ ] **Bundle analysis**: Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- [ ] **Image optimization**: Configure Next.js Image component for production
- [ ] **Caching strategy**: Implement proper caching headers and strategies
- [ ] **Error boundaries**: Enhance error handling for production
- [ ] **Logging configuration**: Set up production logging and monitoring

### Day 3: Deployment Pipeline & Documentation

#### 5. MCP Deployment Setup (Priority: High, Estimate: 4-5 hours)
- [ ] **Linear MCP integration testing**: Test MCP server connection and authentication
- [ ] **Deployment automation**: Create automated deployment scripts
- [ ] **Environment parity**: Ensure staging and production environments match
- [ ] **Rollback procedures**: Implement deployment rollback capabilities
- [ ] **Health checks**: Configure deployment health verification

#### 6. Documentation & Runbook Creation (Priority: High, Estimate: 2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Deployment runbook**: Create comprehensive deployment documentation
- [ ] **Environment setup guide**: Document all environment configuration steps
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide**: Create incident response and debugging procedures
- [ ] **Monitoring setup**: Configure production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Maintenance procedures**: Document regular maintenance tasks

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1 Execution Strategy
1. **Morning**: Focus on test enhancements and SendGrid mock fixes
2. **Afternoon**: Environment configuration and Supabase setup
3. **End of Day**: Test all configurations with `bun run build` and `bun run test`

### Day 2 Execution Strategy
1. **Morning**: Security audit and dependency vulnerability assessment
2. **Afternoon**: Production optimizations and performance tuning
3. **End of Day**: Full security review and production readiness assessment

### Day 3 Execution Strategy
1. **Morning**: MCP deployment testing and automation setup
2. **Afternoon**: Documentation creation and runbook development
3. **End of Day**: Full deployment test and sprint completion verification

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- Linear API access and MCP server running
- Production Supabase instance
- SendGrid production account
- Vercel deployment access
- All environment variables documented

## Risk Mitigation
- **Branch strategy**: Create `stabilization/test-deploy-readiness` branch
- **Incremental testing**: Test each configuration change immediately
- **Backup procedures**: Document rollback procedures before deployment
- **Environment isolation**: Never deploy directly to production without staging verification

## Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ code coverage maintained
- **Build Time**: < 5 minutes for production builds
- **Security Score**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Deployment Time**: < 10 minutes for full deployment
- **Uptime Target**: 99.9% availability post-deployment

## Sprint Completion Checklist
- [ ] `bun run test` passes 100% (66/66 tests)
- [ ] `bun run build` completes successfully
- [ ] MCP deployment to Linear working
- [ ] Production environment fully configured
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Deployment runbook documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

## Notes
- This sprint focuses on stabilization and deployment readiness
- All changes will be made on a dedicated branch for safety
- Daily standups will track progress against the 3-day timeline
- Sprint completion requires successful MCP deployment demonstration
