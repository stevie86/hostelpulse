# Hostelpulse Development Roadmap

## Overall Project Goal
Develop and launch Hostelpulse, a lightweight channel manager that compiles bookings from multiple booking platforms (e.g., Booking.com, Airbnb) into a single, intuitive dashboard for hostel owners. The system must enrich booking data with actionable decision helpers, such as dynamic price recommendations based on market trends, occupancy rates, and competitor analysis, to optimize revenue and occupancy. Additionally, it should include automated features like Lisbon City Tax collection, instant Portuguese factura generation, and centralized inventory management across platforms. The platform aims to significantly increase customer satisfaction by reducing manual workload, minimizing booking errors, and providing hassle-free tools for modern hostel management.

## Target Audience
Small and medium-sized hostels in the Lisbon Anjos area, with a pilot hostel located across the street for testing and validation.

# Sprint 1: Coming Soon Landing Page

## Sprint Goal
Build and deploy a visually appealing "Coming Soon" landing page for Hostelpulse that serves as a public-facing showcase of our product vision and captures interest from potential early adopters. The final result must be a live webpage deployed on Vercel.

## User Stories

### As a hostel owner
- I want to see an attractive hero section so that I understand the product value proposition at first glance.
- I want to see the coming features so that I know what functionality to expect.
- I want to sign up for updates so that I can be notified when the platform is ready.

### As a developer
- I want to create a feature branch so that I can work on the coming soon page without affecting main.
- I want to set up the coming soon page so that it replaces the current homepage.
- I want to deploy the page so that it's live for users.
