# Hostelpulse Development Roadmap

## Overall Project Goal
Develop and launch Hostelpulse, a lightweight channel manager that compiles bookings from multiple booking platforms (e.g., Booking.com, Airbnb) into a single, intuitive dashboard for hostel owners. The system must enrich booking data with actionable decision helpers, such as dynamic price recommendations based on market trends, occupancy rates, and competitor analysis, to optimize revenue and occupancy. Additionally, it should include automated features like Lisbon City Tax collection, instant Portuguese factura generation, and centralized inventory management across platforms. The platform aims to significantly increase customer satisfaction by reducing manual workload, minimizing booking errors, and providing hassle-free tools for modern hostel management.

## Target Audience
Small and medium-sized hostels in the Lisbon Anjos area, with a pilot hostel located across the street for testing and validation.
