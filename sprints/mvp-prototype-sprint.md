# MVP Prototype Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Ship a hosted, clickable prototype at https://hostelpulse-mvp.vercel.app that demonstrates automated tax, invoices, and sync using mock data, allowing a hostel owner to experience the value in under 2 minutes.

## Sprint Duration
1 week (5 working days)

## User Stories

### US1: As a hostel owner, I want to see a demo of automated tax collection so I can understand how it saves time and ensures compliance.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Interactive demo showing tax calculation for a mock booking, displaying amount, process, and time saved.
- **Estimate**: 1 day
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Create mock booking data (guest info, dates, rates)
  - Build tax calculation component (Lisbon City Tax logic)
  - Add demo flow with step-by-step animation
  - Integrate with existing UI components

### US2: As a hostel owner, I want to see a demo of automated invoice generation so I can see how it creates official Portuguese facturas instantly.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Demo showing invoice creation for business traveler, with PDF preview and download.
- **Estimate**: 1 day
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Create mock business traveler data
  - Build invoice template component (Portuguese format)
  - Implement PDF generation (using library like jsPDF)
  - Add demo flow with form input and instant generation

### US3: As a hostel owner, I want to see a demo of inventory sync so I can see how it prevents double bookings across platforms.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Interactive dashboard showing sync between mock OTAs (Booking.com, Hostelworld), with real-time updates.
- **Estimate**: 1 day
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Create mock OTA inventory data
  - Build sync dashboard component
  - Implement simulated real-time updates
  - Add conflict resolution demo

### US4: As a user, I want a cohesive prototype page that guides me through all demos in under 2 minutes.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Single page with navigation between demos, total time <2 min, mobile responsive.
- **Estimate**: 1 day
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Design prototype layout (using Tailwind CSS)
  - Create navigation component
  - Integrate all demo components
  - Add timing analytics (optional)

### US5: Deploy prototype to Vercel at specified URL.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Live at https://hostelpulse-mvp.vercel.app, functional on desktop and mobile.
- **Estimate**: 0.5 days
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - Configure Vercel project
  - Set up custom domain
  - Test deployment
  - Add basic analytics (page views)

## Technical Considerations
- Use existing Next.js 12 setup
- Mock data only (no real APIs or database)
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure responsive design
- Add loading states and animations for better UX

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All user stories completed and tested
- [ ] Prototype loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] Demo flows work on mobile devices
- [ ] Clear value proposition demonstrated
- [ ] Ready for user feedback collection

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Mock data complexity - **Mitigation**: Keep data simple and focused
- **Risk**: Deployment issues - **Mitigation**: Test locally first
- **Risk**: Time overrun - **Mitigation**: Prioritize core demos

## Definition of Done
- Code reviewed and linted
- Prototype deployed and accessible
- All acceptance criteria met
- Demo script prepared for user testing
