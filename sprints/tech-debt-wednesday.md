# Tech-Debt Wednesday Sprint Plan

## Sprint Information
- **Sprint Name**: Tech-Debt Wednesday
- **Date**: September 10th, 2025
- **Duration**: 1 day (Today)
- **Sprint Goal**: Resolve all build errors and critical ESLint warnings to create a stable, clean codebase. The sprint is complete only when `bun run build` executes successfully without any errors.

## Sprint Backlog

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to fix critical TypeScript build errors so that the project compiles successfully.
2. **As a developer**, I want to resolve ESLint errors so that the code adheres to linting rules.
3. **As a developer**, I want to clean up ESLint warnings so that the codebase is hygienic and maintainable.
4. **As a developer**, I want to verify the build succeeds so that the sprint goal is achieved.

### Technical Tasks

#### 1. Fix Critical Build Errors (Priority: High, Estimate: 2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Investigate and fix Type error in WedgeCard.tsx**: The error "File '.../WedgeCard.tsx' is not a module" suggests a TypeScript module resolution issue. Check the import/export syntax and ensure the file is properly recognized as a module.
- [ ] **Fix Cannot find module 'next/navigation' errors**: The project uses Next.js 12.1.0, but next-intl ^4.3.7 requires Next.js 13+. Downgrade next-intl to a compatible version (e.g., ^2.21.4 for Next.js 12) or upgrade Next.js to 13+.
- [ ] **Resolve any other TypeScript compilation errors**: Run build and address any additional errors that surface.

#### 2. Resolve ESLint Errors (Priority: High, Estimate: 1-2 hours)
- [ ] **Fix @next/next/no-html-link-for-pages violation**: Identify files using `<a>` tags for internal Next.js pages and replace with `<Link>` components from `next/link`.
- [ ] **Address any other ESLint errors**: Run linting and fix all reported errors.

#### 3. Clean Up ESLint Warnings (Priority: Medium, Estimate: 1-2 hours)
- [ ] **Fix import/order warnings**: Organize imports according to ESLint rules (e.g., external libraries first, then internal imports, sorted alphabetically).
- [ ] **Remove unused variables**: Identify and remove any declared but unused variables across the codebase.
- [ ] **Address other warnings**: Fix any remaining ESLint warnings for better code hygiene.

#### 4. Final Verification (Priority: High, Estimate: 30 minutes)
- [ ] **Run `bun run build`**: Execute the build command and ensure it completes without errors.
- [ ] **Confirm successful compilation**: Verify that all TypeScript errors are resolved and the build output is clean.
- [ ] **Document any remaining issues**: If any issues persist, document them for future sprints.

## Implementation Plan

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide

1. **Start with Build Errors**:
   - Begin by running `bun run build` to see the current error state.
   - Focus on the next/navigation issue first, as it's likely blocking the build.
   - Check next-intl compatibility and either downgrade the package or upgrade Next.js.

2. **Address Module Issues**:
   - Examine WedgeCard.tsx and its imports/exports.
   - Check for any syntax issues or missing dependencies.
   - Ensure all component files are properly structured.

3. **ESLint Error Resolution**:
   - Run `bun run lint` to identify specific errors.
   - Focus on the no-html-link-for-pages rule violations.
   - Replace `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components.

4. **Warning Cleanup**:
   - Use ESLint auto-fix where possible: `bun run lint --fix`.
   - Manually organize imports and remove unused variables.
   - Review each warning and apply appropriate fixes.

5. **Final Testing**:
   - Run build again to confirm all errors are resolved.
   - Run lint to ensure no errors or warnings remain.
   - Test the application in development mode to verify functionality.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0.0+ (compatible with Next.js 12)
- Bun package manager
- Access to package.json for dependency management
- Text editor with TypeScript and ESLint support

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup current state**: Commit current changes before making modifications.
- **Incremental changes**: Fix one issue at a time and test after each fix.
- **Version compatibility**: Research package versions before upgrading/downgrading.
- **Documentation**: Keep track of changes made for future reference.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `bun run build` completes successfully without errors
- [ ] `bun run lint` shows no errors
- [ ] All critical warnings are addressed
- [ ] Application runs in development mode without issues
- [ ] Codebase is ready for continued feature development

## Notes
- This sprint focuses solely on technical debt resolution.
- All tasks are designed to be completable within one day.
- If Next.js upgrade is chosen, additional testing may be required for compatibility.
- Consider creating a separate branch for these changes to avoid disrupting main development.
