# Governance Mode Design Document

## Overview
The Governance Mode for KiloCode is designed to enforce strict governance rules for code quality gates, security scans, and compliance checks. This mode ensures that all development activities adhere to organizational standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices.

## Mode Capabilities and Limitations

### Capabilities
- **Code Quality Gates**: Enforce coding standards, linting rules, and quality metrics
- **Security Scans**: Automated vulnerability detection and security compliance checks
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensure adherence to regulatory and organizational standards
- **AI Peer Reviews**: Automated code review simulation with best practices validation
- **Governance Rules**: Define and enforce organizational policies and standards
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive records of all governance activities

### Limitations
- Cannot modify code directly - only reports violations and blocks non-compliant actions
- Requires human intervention for rule overrides and exceptions
- Operates within predefined rule boundaries and cannot create new rules autonomously
- Limited to analysis and reporting - implementation requires other modes

## Governance Rule Definitions Framework

### Rule Categories
- **Quality Rules**: Code style, complexity, maintainability
- **Security Rules**: Vulnerability patterns, secure coding practices
- **Compliance Rules**: Regulatory requirements, organizational policies

### Rule Structure
```json
{
  "id": "rule-identifier",
  "category": "quality|security|compliance",
  "severity": "warning|error|block",
  "description": "Rule description",
  "pattern": "regex or condition",
  "threshold": "numeric threshold",
  "inheritance": "global|project|file",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Enforcement Levels
- **Warning**: Logs issue but allows continuation
- **Error**: Blocks action but allows override
- **Block**: Completely prevents action without approval

## Security and Compliance Frameworks

### Security Frameworks
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security standards
- **SAST/DAST**: Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerability checks
- **Secret Detection**: API keys, passwords, sensitive data

### Compliance Frameworks
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy regulations
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security (if applicable)
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards

### Integration Tools
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Checkmarx**: Static application security testing
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing

## Quality Gate Configurations

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum 10 per function
- **Code Duplication**: Maximum 5% duplication
- **Linting Score**: Minimum 95% compliance

### Gate Types
- **Pre-commit Gates**: Run on local commits
- **Pre-merge Gates**: Run on pull requests
- **Pre-deploy Gates**: Run before production deployment
- **Continuous Gates**: Run on scheduled intervals

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "gates": {
    "pre-commit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "metrics": ["linting", "security"],
      "thresholds": {
        "linting_score": 95,
        "security_vulnerabilities": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit and Reporting Mechanisms

### Audit Trail Structure
- **Event Logging**: All governance activities with timestamps
- **User Tracking**: Who performed actions and when
- **Rule Violations**: Detailed violation records
- **Override Records**: Approved exceptions and justifications

### Reporting Features
- **Compliance Dashboards**: Real-time compliance status
- **Violation Summaries**: Aggregated violation reports
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical compliance trends
- **Export Formats**: PDF, JSON, CSV reports

### Storage Architecture
- **Database**: Secure audit trail storage
- **Retention**: Configurable data retention policies
- **Encryption**: Data-at-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to audit data

## Success Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Rule Compliance Rate**: Percentage of compliant activities (target: 95%)
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of violation detection (target: <5%)
- **Response Time**: Time to complete scans (target: <30 seconds)
- **Resolution Time**: Time to resolve violations (target: <24 hours)

### Monitoring Systems
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live compliance status
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for violations
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance tracking
- **Predictive Analytics**: Risk assessment and forecasting

### Success Metrics
```json
{
  "governance_effectiveness": {
    "compliance_rate": 95,
    "false_positive_rate": 3,
    "scan_response_time": 25,
    "violation_resolution_time": 12
  },
  "security_posture": {
    "vulnerability_trend": "decreasing",
    "compliance_score": 92,
    "risk_level": "low"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Configuration

### Mode Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "Governance Mode",
  "slug": "governance",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "code_quality_gates": true,

  },
  "limitations": {
    "no_code_modification": true,
    "human_override_required": true,
    "rule_boundary_restriction": true
  }
}
```

### Workflow Integration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated gates in deployment pipelines
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time feedback in development environment
- **Version Control**: Pre-commit and pre-merge hooks
- **Notification System**: Alerts for violations and approvals

## Validation and Testing

### Validation Criteria
