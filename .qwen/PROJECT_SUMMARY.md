# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Complete and deploy the HostelPulse hostel management SaaS application with proper authentication, API functionality, and database integration.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript
- Local development uses Supabase at http://127.0.0.1:54321
- Environment configuration in .env.local with JWT keys for authentication
- Database schema includes guests, rooms, beds, bookings, housekeeping_tasks, payments, and notifications tables
- Authentication uses Supabase Auth with RLS policies for data isolation
- API routes located in pages/api/ with middleware authentication
- Frontend components built with styled-components
- Local Supabase service role key: sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK-Uodkm0Hg_xSvEMPvz

## Recent Actions
- Fixed environment variables in .env.local with correct Supabase service role key
- Identified and fixed SSR issue in env.ts where window object was referenced server-side
- Created test API routes to debug authentication and database connectivity
- Killed and restarted Next.js development server multiple times
- Verified database schema exists with proper RLS policies
- Confirmed all core tables (guests, rooms, beds, bookings, etc.) are present

## Current Plan
