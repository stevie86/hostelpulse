✅ **Database Schema**: Complete schema with guests, rooms, beds, bookings, and housekeeping tasks
✅ **Authentication**: Working Supabase authentication system
✅ **API Routes**: All CRUD operations for core entities
✅ **UI Components**: Responsive dashboard and management interfaces
✅ **Vercel Configuration**: Proper build commands and settings

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Supabase Setup (Critical)
1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.io](https://supabase.io)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to your Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
4. Copy and execute the schema from `/supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` 
5. Go to Authentication settings and enable email authentication
6. Get your API credentials from Project Settings > API

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=HostelPulse
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and create an account
3. Import your repository
4. Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (Settings > Environment Variables)
5. Deploy the project

## Additional Recommendations for MVP

1. **Email Configuration**: Set up email templates in Supabase for email verification
2. **Analytics**: Consider adding analytics for user behavior insights
3. **Security**: Enable production security headers
4. **Performance**: Monitor Lighthouse scores and optimize as needed
5. **Backup**: Set up Supabase database backup procedures
