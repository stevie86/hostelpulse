# MVP Sprint Report: Operation Clean Slate

**Date:** December 13, 2025  
**Status:** Feature Complete (Local) / Ready for Infrastructure  
**Branch:** `clean-slate`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

We have successfully rebuilt the HostelPulse MVP on a stable, "clean slate" architecture. The application is now a unified Next.js 15 App Router project with strict type safety, zero legacy technical debt, and a functional feature set matching the core "Must-Have" requirements.

**Key Achievement:** The project builds cleanly (`pnpm build`), passes all type checks, and runs locally with a fully functional SQLite database.

---

## 2. Delivered Features (The "Build")

We have implemented 100% of the Week 1-2 "Must-Have" features from the roadmap:

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **NextAuth v5 (Beta):** Secure credential-based login system.
- **Middleware Protection:** Automated route guarding for `/properties/*`.
- **Demo Access:** Pre-configured admin user (`admin@hostelpulse.com`).

### 🏨 Core Property Management

- **Property Dashboard:** Real-time overview of Arrivals, Departures, and Occupancy rates.
- **Room Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for rooms with capacity planning.
- **Guest Management:** Centralized guest database with List views and Creation forms.
- **CSV Import:** Basic infrastructure for bulk guest importing (Spreadsheet migration path).

### 📅 Booking Engine (The "Brain")

- **Conflict Detection:** Server-side logic prevents double-bookings by analyzing date overlaps vs. room capacity.
- **Smart Allocation:** Auto-calculates room availability before confirming reservations.
- **Financials:** Tracks payment status and total amounts per booking.

### 🎨 UI/UX & Architecture

- **Tailwind CSS:** Re-integrated for a clean, mobile-responsive design system.
- **Server Actions:** All data mutations (Create/Delete) use modern Next.js Server Actions for speed and security.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error boundaries for database connection failures.

## 3. Technical Foundation

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20.18.1
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.0.3 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5 (Strict Mode)
- **Database:** SQLite (Local Dev) / PostgreSQL (Schema Compatible)
- **ORM:** Prisma 5.22.0

---

## 4. Critical Pivot Point: The Infrastructure Gap

While the local MVP is robust, **we are currently blocked from Production Deployment** by the database choice.

- **Current State:** SQLite (`file:./dev.db`). Excellent for local speed, but **cannot be deployed to Vercel**.
- **Target State:** PostgreSQL. Required for persistent data in production.
- **The Trade-off:** To enable local dev without Docker, we simplified the schema (removed `Enums` and `Json` types).

**Immediate Risk:** Deploying now requires "un-simplifying" the schema and providing a remote Postgres connection string.

---

## 5. Next Sprint Plan: "Deploy & Validate"

**Goal:** Get a live URL to 5 hostel managers within 48 hours.

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup (Priority 1)

- [ ] **Provision DB:** Create a free PostgreSQL instance (Neon/Supabase/Railway).
- [ ] **Schema Reversion:** Restore `Enums` (Role) and `Json` types in `schema.prisma`.
- [ ] **Env Update:** Replace `DATABASE_URL` with the remote connection string.

### Step 2: Deployment

- [ ] **CI/CD:** Connect GitHub repo to Vercel.
- [ ] **Environment:** Configure Vercel Env Vars (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`).
- [ ] **Build Verify:** Ensure production build succeeds on remote infrastructure.

### Step 3: User Validation

- [ ] **Seed Data:** Populate the live DB with realistic "Demo Hostel" data.
- [ ] **Outreach:** Send the Vercel link to the 5 waiting beta users.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop:** Monitor the feedback inbox.

## 6. Commands Reference

- **Start Local Server:** `pnpm run dev`
- **Build for Prod:** `pnpm build`
- **View Database:** `pnpm exec prisma studio` (requires `dev.db`)
- **Lint Code:** `pnpm lint`
