# HostelPulse: "No Bullshit" Strategy & Lisbon Pilot

## 1. Vision: The Lean Guest Engine
**HostelPulse** is a lean, efficient Property Management System (PMS) built specifically for **small to medium hostels in Lisbon**. 

**The Problem:** Current solutions are either:
1.  **Too Simple:** Excel/Paper (prone to double bookings, manual chaos).
2.  **Too Complex:** Bloated "Enterprise" Channel Managers (expensive, steep learning curve, feature clutter).

**The Solution:** A "No Bullshit" system that handles the heavy lifting so staff can focus on **guests**, not admin.
*   **Simple:** Interface understandable by non-technical volunteers/staff in minutes.
*   **Safe:** Impossible to double-book.
*   **Automated:** Check-in/out workflows and guest communication handled automatically.

## 2. The Lisbon Beachhead Strategy
**Target Market:** ~50-100 Independent Hostels in Lisbon.
**Goal:** Become the de-facto standard in Lisbon by solving their specific pain points better than generic global tools.

### Why Lisbon?
*   High density of independent hostels.
*   Strong community (word of mouth).
*   Needs are specific (SEF reporting, City Tax, rapid turnover).

### Success Metrics (The "Comfort" Metrics)
*   **Zero Double Bookings:** The system must be bulletproof.
*   **Staff Happiness:** "It just works" - no training manuals needed.
*   **Guest Focus Time:** Hours saved on admin that can be spent chatting with guests.

## 4. Technical Strategy: "Operation Bedrock"
*Keep it simple, stable, and fast.*

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, PostgreSQL, Tailwind.
- **Philosophy:**
    - **No "Spaghetti Code":** Strict Types, clean architecture.
    - **Mobile First:** Staff are often standing at reception or moving around.
    - **Offline-First Thinking:** Internet in old Lisbon buildings can be spotty.
